## üî¥ CRITICAL FINDINGS (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Security Critical Issues

#### Container Health Check Protocol Mismatch
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml:75`
- **Issue**: Health check uses HTTP but server runs on HTTPS port 8443
- **Risk**: False health status reporting
- **Fix**: Change to `https://localhost:8443/health` or use `curl -k`

#### In-Memory Storage for Production Data
- **File**: `src/wazuh_mcp_server/auth/oauth2.py:220-234`
- **Issue**: Users, clients, and tokens stored in memory
- **Risk**: Data loss on restart, clustering impossible
- **Impact**: Complete authentication system failure on restart

#### Redis Password Exposure
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml:122`
- **Issue**: Redis password exposed in process command line
- **Risk**: Credential exposure through process monitoring
- **Fix**: Use environment variables or secrets management

### 2. Stability Critical Issues

#### Configuration Security Gap
- **File**: `src/wazuh_mcp_server/config.py:268-328`
- **Issue**: No encryption for sensitive configuration at rest
- **Risk**: Plain text credential storage
- **Impact**: Security breach could expose all API credentials

#### Backup System Failure
- **File**: `scripts/backup-system.sh:176-182`
- **Issue**: Hardcoded Docker Compose file path with spaces
- **Risk**: Complete backup operation failure
- **Impact**: No disaster recovery capability

#### Signal Handler Race Conditions
- **File**: `docker/entrypoint.sh:39-48`
- **Issue**: Signal handlers lack concurrent signal protection
- **Risk**: Incomplete shutdown and data corruption
- **Impact**: Data loss during container restarts

### 3. High Availability Critical Issues

#### Redis Sentinel Split-Brain Risk
- **File**: `docker-compose.ha.yml:58-62`
